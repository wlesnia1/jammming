# Jammming Test Project

A simple project that allows a user to login to their spotify account, search for songs, and add them to a playlist.

# How to use

Follow the login prompt, search for songs, then click the save button to save them to your account.

# Plans for the future

Pull clientID from a config file. Having my Spotify API ClientID showing in a public facing repo is pretty horrendous security. Enjoy wasting my free API calls if you want.
