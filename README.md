# Jammming Test Project

A simple project that allows a user to login to their spotify account, search for songs, and add them to a playlist.

# How to use

Clone the repo; npm install; then npm run dev. Vite should be hosting the site on https://192.168.0.45:5173/. I actually don't know if this will work on other people's machines. I should probably figure that out before linking it on my personal site. Hmm....

# Plans for the future

Get this running on my Github Pages site so I can show it off. I'm not sure if I can host a simple HTML site and a React app on a free account.
